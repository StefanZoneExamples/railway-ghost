## Found a bug? üíÅ‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è

Thanks for letting me know! Please [file an issue](../../issues/new?assignees=&labels=&template=bug_report.md&title=) and I should reply shortly.

## Configuration üìù

Railway's filesystem is ephemeral which is why any changes to the filesystem are not persisted between deploys.

### Environment Variables

- `CLOUDINARY_URL`: For file storage. If you do not add this, your images won't persist between deploys. (**recommended**)
- `MYSQLHOST`: Host of the MySQL database. (**required**)
- `MYSQLPORT`: Port of the MySQL database. (**required**)
- `MYSQLUSER`: User of the MySQL database. (**required**)
- `MYSQLPASSWORD`: Password of the MySQL database. (**required**)
- `MYSQLDATABASE`: Name of the MySQL database. (**required**)

### Themes

To add a theme, first add the package as a dependency to the `package.json` file, then add it to the list of themes in the `bin/themes.sh` file.

**Note**: Do NOT add a theme directly using the Ghost UI, it will look like it worked but will break whenever the app is deployed again.

## Deploying the site üöÄ

The site will build and deploy the `main` branch automatically after every `git push origin main` via [Railway](https://railway.app).
